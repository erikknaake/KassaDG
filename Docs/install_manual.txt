Bundle KassaDG/KassaDG/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/linux-x64/publish with KassaDG/KassaDG/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/linux-x64/Persistence into an archive

Extract the archive on target computer in ~/.KassaDG_linux-64 so that publish and Persistence directory are the next level in ~/.KassaDG_linux-64
Make sure the Persistence/KassaDG.db sqlite database is in the state you want
Make sure the files publish/credentials.json and appsettings.json are present
In appsettings.json you can edit the target GoogleDrive folder and the number of transactions between each backup

Copy the launcher (KassaDG_desktop_launcher.sh) to ~/Dekstop
The launcher depends on ps, grep, command and either google-chrome or /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable

The first time a backup is pushed to google drive the authentication flow must be completed, choose a google account, login. Make sure the folder with the folderId set in appsettings.json is present in this google account

Or just run the setup.sh script when all files are present in the correct folder. The setup also depends on chmod.
